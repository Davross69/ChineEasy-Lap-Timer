# ChineEasy-Lap-Timer
A low-cost race lap timer for drones

There has been a lot of talk about video transmitter triggered lap timing,
and there is one commercial product on the market does this at a price!

This project was cobbled together out of scraps from my DIY draw:
Arduino Uno
Bluetooth serial adapter
5.8 GHz NexWave video receiver
Quadcopter lost model buzzer

It has been tested with one video receiver installed, but there is scope for up to 6.
